These scripts are in-use throughout cashmusic.org, but need tweaks and
updates before being released publicly. The general idea is that there's
a single master JS object that serves as namespace and controller for
any number of smaller script modules. It also launches external scripts
as needed, and can auto-attach behaviors to elements. 

I'll enter proper change requirements in Lighthouse, but the big ones
are that it needs a name change (Mercury/Hg = no good) and should use
library-safe MooTools functions instead of the generic $() route. 

When done I'll also give the SoundPlayer a round of updates and make it
jibe with the master object so we can auto attach to MP3 links, etc.
