##Flower##
Flower provides easily used and easily customized functionality for media pages. 
The primary tools are photo and video lightboxes, some basic behaviors, and an
audio player / playlist manager using SoundManager 2.

This code uses [MooTools](http://mootools.net/), a JavaScript library that provides
enhanced functionality to the JS language. 

Basic usage is as simple as including a few lines of code in the <head> of an
HTML document, or installing a WordPress plugin.
