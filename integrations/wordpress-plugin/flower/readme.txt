Adds MooTools 1.2.4 and Flower 1.0 to the head of a Wordpress template

== Description ==

This plugin adds the CASH Music Flower 1.0 code to a Wordpress template, 
providing image and video lightboxes, sound players, inline mp3 links, and some 
basic AJAX content tools. MooTools 1.2.4 is also added.

== Installation ==

Installing the Flower plugin as you would any other. Download the package, 
extract it, and upload the contents to your `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
Activate it from the plugins menu.

== Usage ==

= Basic Usage =
Flower is designed to be easy to use for the non-nerd, and easy to extend and
use as a base for the nerdier. Most functionality works automatically with
nothing more than a class name added to a div or a link.


= Soundplayer =
To use the Soundplayer module just add the 'flower_soundplayer' class to a 
link or a div. Added to a div it will search the div for links to audio and
populate a player. If no title is present the player will use the text between
the <a> tag as the track title. If you'd like to specify your own title just
add it to the--wait for it--title of the link.

When added to a link element, the 'flower_soundplayer' class will add [play] to
the end of the link text and it will be playable inline. 

A special 'flower_soundplayer_pageplayer' can be added to a div to create a
player from all stray audio links on the page. This only grabs audio that has 
not already been included in a player or given the 'flower_soundplayer' class.


= Imagebox =
To create an Imagebox collection you need only add the 'flower_imagebox' class 
to a link that points to an image. That image will be loaded in a lightbox. You
can also add the 'flower_imagebox' class to a div and all links to images will
be added automatically. 

By default be included in the 'default' collection. To create multiple 
collections either add an id to each 'flower_imagebox' div, or specify a
collection name in the rev attribute like so: 

<a href="image.jpg" rev="imagebox:collection=mine">thumbnail</a>


= Moviebox =
The Moviebox works automatically by scanning for links to YouTube, Vimeo,
Google Video, MySpace TV, and Vevo pages. It also works on links to certain
Quicktime media. Flower will automatically determine if a users browser 
supports Quicktime, Flash (and soon HTML5.) Then it plays a movie at the
default size of 640x360. A title can be added using the title attribute of the
link. Size can be changed using the rev attribute:

<a href="http://vimeo.com/175757" rev="moviebox:width=600,height=450">movie</a>

(Advanced documentation and demos coming soon)



= CSS Classes =
The following classes are set when any content is displayed, allowing all
Flower features to be skinned with ease. Be sure to use the !important
declaration in your styles as all elements have been styled to a default set
of styles already.


= CSS Classes: Soundplayer =
a.flower_soundplayer // add to an audio link for inline play  
	span.flower_soundplayer_inlineplaypause // the inserted play / pause text  

div.flower_soundplayer_pageplayer // added to a div for a page player

div.flower_soundplayer
