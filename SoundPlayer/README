This originally started as an update to Michelle Steigerwalt's excellent 
MooSound script. (http://msteigerwalt.com/widgets/sounds/v1.0/) The code 
has since been rewritten from the ground up with the original intent to
keep it compatible with MooSound. The Flex app was rewritten for AS3, at
which point compatibility was no longer possible and significant changes
have since been made. 

Warning: there will be more changes to the Sound and Playlist object 
structures in the next revision.
